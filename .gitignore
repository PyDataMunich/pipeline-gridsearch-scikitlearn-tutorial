# exclude data from source control by default
#
# The following includes the directory structure under /data, but ignores files (except the empty .gitkeep files whose only purpose is to include the directory structure (git does not allow empty directories to be added)).
# Exclude /data and all its subdirectories and files:
/data/**
# Re-include all subdirectories:
!/data/**/
# Re-include .gitkeep files:
!.gitkeep

Hands-on Pipelines and Gridsearch with scikit-learn
Authors: Florent Martin and Koen van Woerden

Building a data science model usually involves lots of steps: cleaning, preprocessing, vectorizing, predicting, etc. Especially with an interactive notebook, one easily loses track of the various intermediate data outputs. Changing the intermediate processing steps also gets very cumbersome. On top of that trying to optimize the hyperparameters takes a lot of work.
We will show a solution to these problems using Pipelines and Gridsearch with scikit-learn. These techniques will be demonstrated on an NLP classification problem. This talk will also serve as an introduction to scikit-learn.
